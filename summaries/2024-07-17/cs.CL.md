          MICCAI 2024

- **Summary**: The paper introduces EndoFinder, a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) framework designed to facilitate the optical biopsy of colorectal polyps by identifying 'digital twin' polyps from a reference database. The proposed approach utilizes a polyp-aware image encoder that is pre-trained using a combination of masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a universal embedding space for polyp images. Unlike traditional supervised learning models, which can be less interpretable and require extensive labeled datasets, EndoFinder aims to improve diagnostic explainability and applicability in real-time colonoscopy procedures. Validation experiments demonstrate that EndoFinder is capable of providing interpretable diagnostics and achieving performance comparable to supervised models, thereby supporting various downstream decision-making tasks.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'What are the main limitations of traditional supervised learning models in optical polyp diagnosis, and how does EndoFinder address these issues?', 'Answer 1': "Traditional supervised learning models in optical polyp diagnosis suffer from a lack of interpretability and require extensive annotated datasets for training, limiting scalability and continuous clinical application. EndoFinder addresses these issues by employing a content-based image retrieval framework that leverages a pre-trained polyp-aware image encoder using self-supervised learning methods. This approach provides an explainable diagnostic process by identifying 'digital twin' polyps from a reference database, facilitating real-time, interpretable decision-making during colonoscopy procedures."}, {'Question 2': 'Describe the self-supervised learning approach used in EndoFinder to create the polyp-aware image encoder. Why is this approach beneficial for polyp image retrieval?', 'Answer 2': 'EndoFinder employs a self-supervised learning approach that combines masked image modeling with contrastive learning to pre-train the polyp-aware image encoder. This approach generates a universal embedding space that captures the essential features and clinical semantics of polyp images without requiring labeled datasets. This method is beneficial for polyp image retrieval because it allows for the creation of robust, generalizable representations that can be applied across various downstream tasks, resulting in improved retrieval precision and explainability.'}]
