- **Summary**: The paper introduces LMMS-EVAL, a standardized benchmark framework for evaluating Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) across over 50 tasks and more than 10 models. The framework aims to support transparent and reproducible evaluations but faces challenges in maintaining low cost and zero contamination. To address these issues, the authors further develop LMMS-EVAL LITE, which balances coverage and efficiency, and Multimodal LIVEBENCH, which leverages real-time updates from news and online forums to test models' generalization capabilities in a cost-effective, contamination-free manner. The paper underscores the significance of the evaluation trilemma (coverage, cost, contamination) and proposes practical solutions, making contributions toward more reliable benchmarking of LMMs. The authors have open-sourced their code and maintain a leaderboard for ongoing evaluations.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the evaluation trilemma as discussed in the paper and describe how LMMS-EVAL LITE and Multimodal LIVEBENCH aim to address this trilemma in benchmarking Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs).'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the significance of using continuously updating sources like news and online forums in the Multimodal LIVEBENCH. How does this approach aid in testing the generalization capabilities of LMMs effectively?'}]



### The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12771v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12771v1]
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the diffusion of popular hashtags on Twitter, focusing on two social factors: the topology of the Twitter social network and the demographic identity performance of users. By analyzing 1,337 hashtags, the study finds that a combined model of network and identity better predicts certain properties of hashtag cascades compared to single-factor models. While this combined model best predicts overall popularity, network-only models excel in predicting cascade growth, and identity-only models are more effective in predicting adopter composition. The paper highlights how different types of hashtags benefit from different modeling approaches, particularly emphasizing the utility of multi-factor models in understanding the varied roles of network, identity, and other social factors in hashtag diffusion on Twitter.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the significance of combining network topology and user demographic identity in modeling hashtag cascades on Twitter. How does this approach compare to using single-factor models?'}, {'Question 2': 'The paper mentions heterogeneity in the types of hashtags and their modeling requirements. Provide examples of different types of hashtags and discuss which modeling approach (network-only, identity-only, or combined) performs best for each type. How does this reflect on the complex nature of social behavior prediction?'}]

### Is Sarcasm Detection A Step-by-Step Reasoning Process in Large Language Models? (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12725v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12725v1]
13 pages, 2 figures

- **Summary**: The paper discusses the enhancement of sarcasm detection in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a new prompting framework named SarcasmCue. Detecting sarcasm involves understanding a mix of linguistic, contextual, and emotional cues, which is believed to be an intuitive and holistic process rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. SarcasmCue comprises four prompting strategies: Chain of Contradiction (CoC), Graph of Cues (GoC), Bagging of Cues (BoC), and Tensor of Cues (ToC). These strategies help LLMs to detect sarcasm by employing both sequential and non-sequential methods. Empirical evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that these prompting methods outperform standard IO prompting, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Tree of Thought (ToT) strategies. Furthermore, non-sequential prompting generally yields better results than sequential prompting.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Describe the fundamental differences between the sequential and non-sequential prompting methods utilized in the SarcasmCue framework. Why do non-sequential methods generally perform better than sequential methods in sarcasm detection?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explore the four different prompting strategies proposed within the SarcasmCue framework. How do these strategies leverage linguistic, contextual, and emotional cues to enhance sarcasm detection performance in LLMs compared to traditional methods like CoT and ToT?'}, {'Question 3': 'How does the empirical evaluation process on the benchmarking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the SarcasmCue prompting strategies? Discuss the metrics and evaluation criteria used to compare the performance of SarcasmCue with standard IO prompting and other existing strategies.'}, {'Question 4': 'Given the complexity of human sarcasm interpretation, propose potential limitations or challenges that the SarcasmCue framework might face when implemented in real-world applications. How might future research address these challenges?'}]



### TTSDS -- Text-to-Speech Distribution Score (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12707v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12707v1]
Under review for SLT 2024

- **Summary**: The discussed paper addresses the evaluation metrics for modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, noting that traditional evaluation methods might not be sufficient for newer architectures and datasets. The authors propose an evaluation methodology that considers multiple factors including prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. By measuring the distance of synthetic speech from real and noise datasets in these dimensions, they aim to reflect how closely synthetic speech approximates natural speech. The methodology is tested on 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024, showing strong correlation between this composite score and human evaluations over time.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'What specific factors do the authors propose to evaluate in synthetic speech to better mirror real speech, and why might these be significant compared to traditional singular metrics?', 'Answer 1': 'The authors propose evaluating synthetic speech using prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility as key factors. These factors are significant because traditional singular metrics may not capture the full spectrum of qualities that make synthetic speech sound natural. Prosody affects the rhythm and intonation, speaker identity encompasses the unique vocal traits of the individual, and intelligibility ensures clarity and comprehension. Together, these provide a more holistic evaluation.'}, {'Question 2': 'How did the authors validate the effectiveness of their proposed evaluation methodology, and what were the key findings from benchmarking the 35 TTS systems?', 'Answer 2': 'The authors validated their evaluation methodology by benchmarking 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and comparing their composite scores with human evaluations from the same periods. They found that their score, computed as an unweighted average of prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility factors, strongly correlates with human assessment, indicating that their method effectively reflects the quality of synthetic speech.'}]



### Subgraph-Aware Training of Text-based Methods for Knowledge Graph Completion (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12703v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12703v1]
8 pages, including appendix with 8 figures and 12 tables, currently
  under open review for EMNLP 2024

- **Summary**: The paper proposes a novel approach to improve knowledge graph completion (KGC) by integrating structural properties of knowledge graphs (KGs) with pre-trained language models (PLMs). Traditional PLM-based methods focus on encoding textual information, typically overlooking the topological structure of KGs. The authors introduce the Subgraph-Aware Training framework for KGC (SATKGC), which incorporates structural knowledge through two main innovations: subgraph-aware mini-batching that promotes hard negative sampling, and a new contrastive learning method that targets harder entities and negative triples based on their structural features. This research marks the first comprehensive effort to integrate the structural inductive bias from subgraphs into PLM fine-tuning. The efficacy of SATKGC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four KGC benchmarks, showing its clear advantage over existing methods.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain how subgraph-aware mini-batching enhances hard negative sampling in the context of knowledge graph completion and why this is crucial for improving model performance.'}, {'Question 2': 'Describe the new contrastive learning method introduced in SATKGC. How does focusing on harder entities and negative triples utilizing structural properties enhance the learning process?'}]



### Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12665v1]
- **Summary**: The paper addresses the high computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs), which traditionally predict the next token in a sequence. To overcome this, the authors introduce 'patch-level training,' where multiple tokens are compressed into a single patch. The language model is first trained on shorter sequences of patches, followed by traditional token-level training to align with the inference mode. This approach halves the computational costs without performance loss, as demonstrated on models ranging from 370M to 2.7B parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/shaochenze/PatchTrain.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the concept of patch-level training and how it differs from token-level training in terms of sequence processing and computational efficiency.'}, {'Question 2': 'Describe the two-phase training approach proposed in the paper. How does it ensure that the benefits of patch-level training carry over to the final model used during inference?'}]

### AgentPoison: Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12784v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784v1]
22 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables

- **Summary**: The paper discusses a new attack method called AgentPoison, which is the first backdoor attack that targets generic and RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) LLM (Large Language Model) agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. AgentPoison works by creating a backdoor trigger through constrained optimization, ensuring that instances with the trigger in user instructions will retrieve malicious demonstrations from the poisoned knowledge base with high probability, while benign instructions remain unaffected. This method does not require additional model training or tuning and offers high transferability, coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments show that AgentPoison is highly effective, achieving an average attack success rate of over 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) at a poison rate of less than 0.1%. The experiments were conducted on three real-world LLM agents: autonomous driving, knowledge-intensive QA, and healthcare EHRAgent.

How does this feature contribute to the attack's practicality and stealthiness?"}, {'Question 5': 'Evaluate the experiments conducted in the paper. How did the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentPoison across different types of real-world LLM agents, and what are the key takeaways from these experiments?'}]

### Graph Signal Processing for Cross-Domain Recommendation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12374v1]
- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenges in Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR), which aims to leverage user-item interactions from dense domains to alleviate data sparsity and cold start issues. Existing CDR methods often struggle with sensitivity to the ratio of overlapping users and intrinsic differences between the source and target domains. The authors propose CGSP, a framework that utilizes Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to construct a cross-domain similarity graph, combining target-only similarity and source-bridged similarity. This framework processes personalized graph signals for users from both domains, supporting inter-domain and intra-domain recommendations. Empirical results show that CGSP outperforms current encoder-based CDR methods, particularly when the ratio of overlapping users is low, thus demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

ECCV 2024

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the limitation of pre-trained vision and language (V&L) models in cross-modal image-text retrieval, specifically their inadequate performance with small objects. Drawing from human cognition, which focuses more on significant objects regardless of their size, the authors propose a new framework called 'object-aware query perturbation.' This approach creates a key feature subspace for detected objects and perturbs the queries accordingly, enhancing the model's attention to objects within the images. Notably, this method succeeds in improving retrieval performance without needing additional fine-tuning of existing V&L models. The proposed framework was validated through comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, consistently outperforming conventional algorithms.

- **Summary**: The paper discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling domain-specific, knowledge-intensive queries, particularly in the context of using knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve question-answering tasks. Despite access to KG-extracted information, LLMs often fail to generate accurate answers. The study identifies eight critical failure points primarily related to the deficiencies in understanding the question's intent and gathering the relevant context from the KG facts. To address these issues, the authors propose the Mindful-RAG approach, which focuses on intent-based and contextually aligned knowledge retrieval, resulting in enhanced correctness and relevance in LLM responses.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'What are some identified critical failure points in current KG-based RAG methods, and how do they affect the accuracy of LLM-generated answers?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain how the Mindful-RAG approach addresses the deficiencies in existing retrieval-augmented generation systems. Provide examples of how intent-based and contextually aligned knowledge retrieval can improve LLM performance.'}]
