- **Summary**: The paper discusses the limitations of refusal training in language models (LLMs) designed to prevent harmful outputs. It focuses on how such models can be 'jailbroken' by simply rephrasing harmful requests into the past tense. Through systematic evaluation, the study demonstrates how this technique significantly increases the likelihood of bypassing refusal mechanisms in various LLMs like GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and others. For instance, the success rate of this attack on GPT-4o jumps from 1% in direct requests to 88% when harmful requests are reformulated into past tense. The paper suggests that models generally treat historical questions as more benign than hypothetical future questions. However, the study also shows that improving the refusal guardrails is possible by including past tense examples in the fine-tuning data. Overall, the research questions the robustness and generalizability of current alignment techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), and adversarial training.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How does the past tense reformulation technique exploit the refusal guardrails in language models, and why do you think such models treat historical questions more benignly?'}, {'Question 2': 'Based on the findings of the paper, how might fine-tuning with past tense examples improve model robustness against past tense reformulations? What implications does this have for the generalizability of other adversarial training techniques?'}, {'Question 3': "Critically evaluate the limitations of SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training methods as discussed in the paper. How do these limitations contribute to the brittleness observed in LLMs' refusal mechanisms?"}, {'Question 4': 'Considering the effectiveness of past tense reformulations in evading refusal mechanisms, propose an alternative approach to enhance the refusal training of LLMs and justify its potential effectiveness.'}, {'Question 5': 'The paper mentions that future tense reformulations are less effective compared to past tense ones. Discuss the possible psychological and linguistic factors that might contribute to this observation.'}]

- **Summary**: The paper presents NeedleBench, a framework designed for assessing the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in bilingual settings. NeedleBench includes tasks of varying difficulty levels and lengths (ranging from 4k to over 1 million tokens) that aim to test LLMs' abilities to retrieve and reason based on critical information inserted at different depths within the text. Additionally, the paper introduces the Ancestral Trace Challenge (ATC) to simulate real-world logical reasoning tasks encountered in long-context scenarios. The authors evaluated leading open-source models using these frameworks and found substantial limitations in current LLMs' abilities to effectively handle long texts and complex reasoning tasks. All relevant codes and resources are made available via OpenCompass.

### Rethinking Transformer-based Multi-document Summarization: An Empirical Investigation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11948v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11948v1]
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the performance and behaviors of Transformer-based models in multi-document summarization (MDS). To comprehensively analyze these models, the authors conduct five empirical studies: (1) measuring the impact of document boundary separators, (2) exploring the efficacy of different Transformer structures, (3) examining the sensitivity of encoders and decoders, (4) discussing various training strategies, and (5) discovering repetition issues in summary generation. The experiments, conducted on prevalent MDS datasets and evaluated using eleven metrics, reveal several significant findings: document boundary separators influence performance, different Transformer structures offer varied granularity of feature levels, and training strategies impact summarization quality. Notably, decoders are more sensitive to noise compared to encoders, emphasizing their critical role. Additionally, high uncertainty scores correlate with repetition problems in generated summaries. These insights suggest directions for future research to enhance MDS.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'What empirical evidence does the paper provide to support the claim that decoders exhibit greater sensitivity to noise compared to encoders in Transformer-based MDS models?'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss how the authors quantitatively measured the impact of document boundary separators in Transformer-based MDS models. What were the key findings and their implications?'}, {'Question 3': 'Analyze the effectiveness of different mainstream Transformer structures as explored in this study. How do these structures affect the granularity of feature levels in MDS?'}, {'Question 4': 'Examine the different training strategies discussed in the paper. How do these strategies influence the overall performance and quality of multi-document summaries generated by Transformer-based models?'}, {'Question 5': 'The paper highlights the correlation between high uncertainty scores and repetition problems in generated summaries. How was this correlation established, and what might be the underlying reasons for this relationship?'}]

  https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2024-lfqa-hallucination

- **Summary**: The paper focuses on addressing hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in long-form question answering (LFQA). It introduces HaluQuestQA, a unique dataset that includes detailed error annotations for both human-written and model-generated answers. The dataset contains 698 QA pairs with 4.7k span-level annotations covering five types of errors. The authors use this data to analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers, revealing issues with comprehensiveness and unhelpful references. They train an automatic feedback model on this dataset to predict error spans and provide explanations. They then propose an Error-informed refinement approach, which leverages the feedback model to improve generated answers. The refined answers show reduced hallucinations and enhanced quality, with human evaluations indicating a strong preference (84%) for the refined answers over baseline responses.

### A Novel Lexicon for the Moral Foundation of Liberty (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11862v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11862v1]
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the moral value of liberty within the context of social issues like vaccine hesitancy, climate change, and abortion rights. The authors propose a new Liberty lexicon evaluated on a dataset comprising more than 3,000 manually annotated instances, both from within the trained domain and from external domains. They develop a combined lexicon derived from an ensemble of lexicons created using word embedding similarity and compositional semantics techniques. The main contributions include the enhancement of liberty-related annotations and the creation of a robust liberty lexicon for extensive applications. The study uncovers the varying complexity of liberty-related expressions across different platforms and indicates the need for combined knowledge approaches to improve learning system representations.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How do the authors integrate word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics (CS) techniques to develop the final Liberty lexicon, and what are the advantages of combining these methods?'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the challenges faced when annotating expressions related to liberty across different platforms, as highlighted in the paper.

### Evaluating Task-Oriented Dialogue Consistency through Constraint Satisfaction (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11857v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11857v1]
- **Summary**: The paper presents a new approach to ensuring consistency in task-oriented dialogues by framing the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this context, dialogue segments that reference the conversational domain are considered variables, and the constraints among these variables reflect various aspects such as linguistic, conversational, and domain-based properties. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CSP in detecting inconsistencies in dialogues, particularly those re-lexicalized by large language models (LLMs). Their findings reveal that using CSP is effective for inconsistency detection and highlight the challenge faced by state-of-the-art LLMs in maintaining dialogue consistency, with a low accuracy rate of 0.15 when compared to a CSP solver. An ablation study shows that constraints derived from domain knowledge are particularly difficult to respect. The paper advocates for CSP as a robust method to capture core dialogue consistency properties that are often overlooked by traditional approaches based on component pipelines.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the rationale behind using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework for ensuring dialogue consistency. How do variables and constraints within this framework correlate to dialogue segments and properties?'}, {'Question 2': "Based on the study's findings, what are the primary challenges that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) face in maintaining dialogue consistency? How does the CSP-based approach address these challenges more effectively?"}, {'Question 3': "Discuss the implications of the ablation study's results regarding constraints derived from domain knowledge. Why do these constraints pose more significant challenges, and what could be potential strategies to overcome these difficulties?"}, {'Question 4': 'Critique the statement that CSP captures core properties of dialogue consistency that are poorly considered by component pipeline approaches. What are the limitations of component pipeline methods, and how does CSP provide a more comprehensive solution?'}, {'Question 5': 'Design an experiment, building on the methodology of this paper, to test the effectiveness of CSP in a different type of dialogue system (e.g., open-domain conversational agents). What modifications might be necessary to apply this framework to a new domain, and what hypotheses would you test?'}]



### Scaling Sign Language Translation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11855v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11855v1]
- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of Sign Language Translation (SLT) and pushes the boundaries by scaling up pretraining data, model size, and translation directions. The authors performed large-scale SLT pretraining on diverse datasets, including noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, parallel text corpora, and augmented SLT data using machine translation models for video captions. They unified these pretraining tasks under the encoder-decoder architecture, bootstrapping the SLT model with m/ByT5 models. Results on benchmarks like How2Sign and FLEURS-ASL#0 (translating ASL to 42 spoken languages) show the benefits of scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer, demonstrating improved performance even in zero-shot SLT. Fine-tuning these models on five open-domain SLT benchmarks for five sign languages showed significant improvements over previous baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How does the paper address the challenge of narrow domains and limited sign languages in SLT, and what specific strategies were employed to create a more generalized SLT model?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the concept of cross-lingual cross-modal transfer as utilized in this paper, and discuss its impact on the performance of the SLT models in zero-shot settings.'}, {'Question 3': 'Describe the architecture of the pretraining task unification mentioned in the paper. How does it contribute to the performance improvements over vanilla baselines?'}, {'Question 4': 'What is the role of noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data in the pretraining process, and why is it significant for the model’s robustness in open-domain SLT tasks?'}, {'Question 5': 'Discuss the importance of using pretrained (m/By)T5 models for initializing the SLT model. How does this choice impact the training efficiency and the final model performance?'}]



### Zero-shot Cross-Lingual Transfer for Synthetic Data Generation in Grammatical Error Detection (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11854v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11854v1]
Submitted to EMNLP 2024

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of Grammatical Error Detection (GED) in low-resource languages, where human-annotated error corpora are not available. The researchers capitalize on the zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models to create synthetic errors in multiple languages. They introduce a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline: first, the GED model is fine-tuned on synthetic multilingual data from target languages, and subsequently on human-annotated GED corpora from source languages. This strategy surpasses existing state-of-the-art annotation-free GED methods. Additionally, the errors generated by this method are found to be more varied and closer to human errors compared to those produced by other strong baselines.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the two-stage fine-tuning pipeline proposed in the paper and discuss why it might lead to better performance in GED for low-resource languages.'}, {'Question 2': 'Critically evaluate the use of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from multilingual pre-trained language models for generating synthetic errors. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach in the context of low-resource languages?'}]

21 pages

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the geographical bias in large language models (LLMs) that results in skewed or inaccurate responses for queries requiring localized knowledge outside of the typically Western, English-speaking contexts. The authors introduce a benchmark named LoFTI (Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales), which evaluates LLMs based on their ability to accurately localize and transfer factual information about entities to various locations within India, ranging from country-level to city-level granularity. LoFTI includes a diverse set of factual statements about entities in different categories from global source locations to Indian target locations. The benchmark is used to evaluate the performance of GPT-4, Mixtral, and two other Mixtral-based models, revealing that even advanced models like GPT-4 struggle with producing accurate localized information across different levels of hyperlocality within India.

### PipeInfer: Accelerating LLM Inference using Asynchronous Pipelined Speculation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11798v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11798v1]
11 pages, submitted to SC24 conference

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenges of inference across computer clusters for large language models (LLMs) and proposes PipeInfer, a pipelined speculative acceleration technique. Traditional speculative execution methods, inspired by CPU speculative execution, often lead to increased end-to-end latency due to variable speculation acceptance rates. PipeInfer aims to mitigate these issues by introducing Continuous Asynchronous Speculation and Early Inference Cancellation. These mechanisms enhance both latency and generation speed, with a reported improvement of up to 2.15 times over standard speculative inference. Continuous Asynchronous Speculation allows for simultaneous single-token inference with multiple speculative runs, while Early Inference Cancellation halts the computation of invalidated runs early to save resources and time. The system shows better tolerance to low acceptance rates and low-bandwidth interconnects and improves utilization in single-request scenarios.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the key challenges that traditional speculative execution techniques face in LLM inference and how these issues are exacerbated in pipeline-parallel designs?'}, {'Question 2': 'Describe the mechanisms of Continuous Asynchronous Speculation and Early Inference Cancellation. How do they contribute to the improvements in latency and generation speed in PipeInfer?'}]

Next Generation of AI Safety Workshop, 41st International Conference
  on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)

- **Summary**: The study investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce deceptive outputs during information-seeking tasks, specifically in reading comprehension. By using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, the researchers compare outcomes when models are prompted to provide accurate information, subtly misleading information, or completely incorrect arguments. The results show that deceptive guidance from GPT-4 can significantly reduce task accuracy by up to 23% when compared to truthful guidance. However, providing additional context to the user model can mitigate the deceptive influence to some extent. This research underscores the potential for LLMs to generate misleading information and its implications for real-world applications.

### Robust Utility-Preserving Text Anonymization Based on Large Language Models (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11770v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11770v1]
- **Summary**: The paper addresses the need for effective text anonymization to protect sensitive data from re-identification attacks by Large Language Models (LLMs). Given the sophisticated re-identification abilities of LLMs, anonymization efforts must maintain a balance between privacy and data utility for downstream tasks. The authors propose a framework comprised of three LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component. This framework is designed to enable collaborative anonymization. To adapt these capabilities for large-scale and real-time applications, the authors use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to distill the anonymization process into a lightweight model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed models perform better than existing baselines in minimizing re-identification risks while preserving data utility. The code and dataset are made available via a GitHub repository.

### How Are LLMs Mitigating Stereotyping Harms? Learning from Search Engine Studies (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11733v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11733v1]
Accepted at AAAI/ACM AI, Ethics, and Society

- **Summary**: The paper discusses the focus of commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) on 'safety' training related to legal liabilities, often at the expense of evaluating social impact. A novel evaluation task is introduced to assess stereotyping in LLMs using autocompletion prompts. The evaluation involves metrics such as refusal rates, toxicity, sentiment, and regard, tested with and without safety system prompts. Findings suggest that while safety system prompts improve stereotyping outputs, there remains a significant lack of attention to harms classified as toxic, especially concerning ethnicities and sexual orientation. Intersectional identities are particularly prone to triggering disproportionate stereotyping. The paper calls for accountability from model builders, academics, NLP practitioners, and policymakers in light of these findings, emphasizing the need for careful training data curation, appropriate leaderboard design and usage, and rigorous social impact measurement.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain how the authors used autocompletion prompts to evaluate stereotyping in LLMs. Describe the experimental setup and the metrics used.'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the significance of the findings related to intersectional identities and stereotyping in LLMs. What implications do these findings have for the future integration of LLMs and search engines?'}]

### Harnessing Large Language Models for Multimodal Product Bundling (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11712v2) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11712v2]
under review

- **Summary**: Product bundling combines individual items into strategic packages, which is essential for online services. While recent methods use multimodal information, they face challenges like poor semantic understanding, limited knowledge scope, and cold-start issues. Large Language Models (LLMs), known for extensive knowledge and reasoning, struggle with multimodal input directly. The paper introduces Bundle-LLM, a solution that integrates multimodal information through hybrid item tokenization, using a fusion module and trainable projector to embed non-textual features into a single token. This approach not only demonstrates intermodal synergies but also improves efficiency by reducing prompt length. Product bundling is framed as a multiple-choice question with candidate items. A progressive optimization strategy is employed to fine-tune LLMs for distinct objectives, enhancing their semantic understanding for effective product bundling. Experiments on four datasets across two domains show that Bundle-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the limitations faced by recent product bundling methods in handling multimodal information.

- **Summary**: The paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of temporal event forecasting, which has been relatively unexplored compared to other data mining tasks like knowledge question answering and mathematical reasoning. The authors create a novel benchmark dataset named MidEast-TE-mini, which includes both graph and textual data, to facilitate this exploration. They then design baseline methods incorporating various input formats and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules. Their experiments reveal that merely integrating raw texts does not improve the zero-shot extrapolation performance of LLMs. However, when these texts are specific to complex events and the LLMs are fine-tuned accordingly, there is a significant performance boost. They also find that adding retrieval modules helps LLMs capture hidden temporal relational patterns effectively. Despite these advancements, issues like popularity bias and the long-tail problem remain, particularly in the RAG-based methods. The study offers a deeper understanding and highlights promising directions for future research in LLM-based temporal event forecasting.

Discuss how fine-tuning with specific complex events overcomes this issue.'}, {'Question 3': 'Explain the significance of the newly constructed benchmark dataset MidEast-TE-mini. How does it address the challenges in evaluating LLMs for temporal event forecasting?'}, {'Question 4': 'Discuss the persistent issues of popularity bias and the long-tail problem in the context of RAG-based methods for temporal event forecasting. What implications do these issues have for future research?'}, {'Question 5': 'What are the key findings from the extensive experiments conducted in the paper, and how do they contribute to our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods?'}]



### Interactions with Generative Information Retrieval Systems (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11605v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11605v1]
Draft of a chapter intended to appear in a forthcoming book on
  generative information retrieval, co-edited by Chirag Shah and Ryen White

- **Summary**: The paper discusses the transformative potential of generative Information Retrieval (IR) systems compared to traditional search engines. Traditional search engines limit user interactions to predefined actions like requerying, clicking documents, and scrolling. However, generative IR systems enable richer and more natural forms of expression and feedback. These systems allow users to articulate their information needs in natural language and beyond, incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, and gestures through multi-modal interfaces. The chapter covers various facets of user interaction in generative IR systems, including explicit and implicit feedback mechanisms, interactive refinement of retrieval results, mixed-initiative interactions, clarification and preference elicitation, proactive features like context-aware recommendations, and the continuation of past conversations. The paper also touches on providing explanations as an interaction type and describes emerging frameworks for user interfaces leveraging generative AI.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How do generative IR systems expand the modes of user interaction beyond traditional predefined actions in search engines, and what are the implications of such expanded interactions for user experience and information retrieval performance?'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the role and significance of proactive features in generative IR systems. How do context-aware recommendations and the ability to follow up on past conversations enhance user engagement and information retrieval effectiveness?'}, {'Question 3': 'What are mixed-initiative interactions in generative IR systems, and how do they help in refinement of retrieval results? Provide examples of how clarification and preference elicitation might occur in such interactions.'}, {'Question 4': 'Explain how multi-modal interactions in generative IR systems can improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of information retrieval. What challenges might arise in implementing these interactions effectively?'}, {'Question 5': 'Describe the methods by which users can provide explicit or implicit feedback in generative IR systems. How can these systems utilize such feedback to refine and improve search outcomes?'}]



### A PLMs based protein retrieval framework (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11548v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11548v1]
16 pages, 12 figures

- **Summary**: The paper presents a novel protein retrieval framework designed to address the limitations of sequence-similarity prioritization in traditional methods such as BLAST. The new framework utilizes protein language models (PLMs) to embed protein sequences into a high-dimensional feature space, which enhances their representation capabilities. An accelerated indexed vector database is then used to facilitate fast retrieval of these dense vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can retrieve proteins that are both similar and dissimilar, thereby uncovering proteins that traditional methods might overlook. This advance is expected to aid in protein mining and further biological research.

How does the proposed framework overcome these limitations?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the role of protein language models (PLMs) in the proposed protein retrieval framework. How do PLMs enhance the representation of protein sequences in a high-dimensional feature space?'}, {'Question 3': 'Discuss the importance and function of an accelerated indexed vector database in the proposed framework. How does this database contribute to the efficiency of protein retrieval?'}, {'Question 4': 'What are the potential biological implications and applications of being able to retrieve both similar and dissimilar proteins, as demonstrated by the proposed framework?'}]



### Bootstrapped Pre-training with Dynamic Identifier Prediction for Generative Retrieval (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11504v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11504v1]
Accepted by ACL Findings 2024

- **Summary**: The paper presents BootRet, a novel bootstrapped pre-training method for generative retrieval. Generative retrieval, which uses differentiable search indexes to directly generate relevant document identifiers in response to a query, shows potential improvement when pre-trained with well-designed tasks. However, traditional methods suffer from using static document identifiers that may not keep up with evolving model parameters. BootRet addresses this issue by dynamically updating document identifiers throughout pre-training. The methodology consists of three key phases: initial generation of document identifiers, corpus indexing and relevance prediction pre-training, and identifier updates via bootstrapping. Further, the method incorporates noisy documents and pseudo-queries produced by large language models to enhance semantic connections during training. Empirical evaluations show that BootRet outperforms existing baselines and retains effectiveness even in zero-shot scenarios.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Discuss the limitations of relying on static document identifiers in generative retrieval models and explain how BootRet overcomes these limitations.'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the three key training phases of BootRet and their individual contributions to improving generative retrieval.'}, {'Question 3': 'How do noisy documents and pseudo-queries generated by large language models enhance the pre-training of BootRet, and what are the implications for semantic connections in indexing and retrieval tasks?'}, {'Question 4': "Evaluate the performance metrics used in the paper to validate BootRet's superiority over existing baselines and discuss potential reasons for its success in zero-shot settings."}, {'Question 5': 'Propose potential improvements or future research directions for BootRet based on its current methodology and experimental results.'}]



### EndoFinder: Online Image Retrieval for Explainable Colorectal Polyp Diagnosis (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11401v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11401v1]
MICCAI 2024

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenge of determining the necessity of resecting malignant polyps during colonoscopy by proposing EndoFinder, a content-based image retrieval framework. EndoFinder is designed to find a 'digital twin' of newly detected polyps in a reference database, which helps infer the clinical semantics of the new polyp based on the matched ones. The framework employs a polyp-aware image encoder pre-trained on a large dataset using self-supervised learning techniques, combining masked image modeling with contrastive learning. This creates a versatile embedding space suitable for various clinical tasks involving image retrieval. The framework is validated through polyp re-identification and optical biopsy tasks, demonstrating both explainable diagnostics and competitive performance compared to supervised classification models. EndoFinder offers a potential aid for real-time decision-making during colonoscopy procedures.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How does EndoFinder enhance explainability in the optical biopsy of polyps compared to traditional deep learning-based classification models?'}, {'Question 2': 'Describe how the combination of masked image modeling and contrastive learning is employed in EndoFinder. How does this combination contribute to the creation of a beneficial embedding space for polyp image retrieval?'}, {'Question 3': "Examine the challenges associated with real-time decision-making during colonoscopy that EndoFinder aims to address. How does the concept of 'digital twin' aid in overcoming these challenges?"}, {'Question 4': 'What are the additional downstream clinical tasks that could benefit from using EndoFinder’s image retrieval-based approach, and why?'}, {'Question 5': 'In validating EndoFinder, the paper mentions polyp re-identification and optical biopsy tasks. Discuss the importance of validating these specific tasks and the methods used to demonstrate the effectiveness of EndoFinder in these areas.'}]



### Pacer and Runner: Cooperative Learning Framework between Single- and Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11245v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11245v1]
Accepted at SIGIR'24

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenges associated with Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), which integrates information from multiple domains to enhance recommendation systems. Despite the potential advantages of CDSR over Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR), it often faces negative transfer issues, where the unrelatedness of domains or varying data sparsity levels can degrade performance. The authors propose a CDSR model that mitigates negative transfer by estimating its degree per domain and adjusting the prediction loss weight accordingly, thus controlling gradient flows. The model uses an asymmetric cooperative network to compare CDSR and SDSR performance and evaluates negative transfer. Additionally, an auxiliary loss function is introduced to maximize mutual information between SDSR and CDSR representations, further facilitating the exchange of useful information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superiority over previous approaches, and its deployment in a real-world application yielded a significant improvement in click-through rates.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'How does the proposed model handle negative transfer in CDSR, and what role do the weight factors play in this context?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the concept of the asymmetric cooperative network used in the model.

### SEMINAR: Search Enhanced Multi-modal Interest Network and Approximate Retrieval for Lifelong Sequential Recommendation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10714v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10714v1]
9 pages,code released

- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenges in modeling user behaviors for recommendation systems, specifically for Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction and Personalized Search Ranking (PSR). Existing models struggle with the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding, especially when new IDs appear in the lifelong sequence features but not in the training dataset. Additionally, current target attention mechanisms are ineffective in learning the multi-modal representations (text, image, attributes) of items, leading to misaligned distributions across modalities. The authors propose SEMINAR (Search Enhanced Multi-Modal Interest Network and Approximate Retrieval), a unified lifelong multi-modal sequence model. This model leverages a Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) to learn the multi-modal query-item pairs with multiple pretraining objectives, including multi-modal alignment and query-item relevance prediction. After pretraining, the downstream model uses the pretrained embedding for initialization and finetunes the network. To improve online retrieval speed, a multi-modal codebook-based product quantization strategy is introduced to approximate the exact attention calculation.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding in lifelong sequences and discuss its implications for recommendation systems in the context of CTR prediction and PSR.'}, {'Question 2': "Describe the multi-modal alignment issue in existing target attention mechanisms and how SEMINAR's Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) addresses this challenge."}, {'Question 3': 'How does the proposed multi-modal codebook-based product quantization strategy contribute to the efficiency of online retrieval in SEMINAR? Provide a detailed explanation of the method and its advantages.'}, {'Question 4': 'Critically analyze the multiple pretraining objectives (e.g., next query-item pair prediction, query-item relevance prediction) of the PSU. How do these objectives contribute to the overall performance of SEMINAR?'}]

### General algorithm of assigning raster features to vector maps at any resolution or scale (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10599v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10599v1]
- **Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of fusing multi-source geographic data, specifically raster and vector data, which have differing structures and scales. Traditional methods struggle with preserving the integrity of each data source during fusion. The authors propose a general algorithm designed to overcome these technical difficulties by assigning features from raster data (e.g., air pollutant concentrations) to vector components (e.g., road edges) in city maps. The algorithm iteratively constructs virtual layers, expanding geolocation progressively from city centers to boundaries on a 2D map. This method uses the concept of perfect squares and adjusts based on the ratio of city size to raster resolution. The algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to assign PM$_{2.5}$ and NO$_{2}$ concentration data to roads in 1692 cities worldwide, facilitating graph-based pollution analysis. The proposed method offers a general and efficient approach for fusing datasets of various scales, with potential applications in climate studies.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the significance of the iterative construction of virtual layers in the proposed algorithm. How does this approach ensure the integrity and accuracy of fusing raster and vector datasets in geographic applications?', 'Answer 1': 'The iterative construction of virtual layers allows for systematic expansion from the city center to its boundaries, ensuring that data points are accurately mapped onto geographic features (such as roads) despite varying resolutions and scales. This approach maintains the integrity of each dataset by creating a structured and consistent method for data assignment, reducing potential errors in data fusion. By following the rule of perfect squares and adjusting for city size to raster resolution ratios, the method ensures each data point is appropriately assigned, preserving the fidelity of both air pollution data and geographic coordinates.'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss how the proposed algorithm adjusts for the oddness or evenness of the ratio of city size to raster resolution. What are the implications of these adjustments on the scalability and applicability of the method in diverse geographic contexts?', 'Answer 2': 'The algorithm takes into account whether the ratio of city size to raster resolution is odd or even, adjusting the construction of virtual layers accordingly to maintain consistent coverage and accurate mapping of data points. For an odd ratio, the algorithm may need to consider extra layers or specific allocations to ensure complete coverage, while an even ratio can follow a more straightforward application of perfect squares. This consideration ensures that the method is adaptable to cities of various sizes and raster resolutions, enhancing its scalability and applicability in diverse geographic contexts. The adjustments ensure that the method is versatile and can be generalized across different urban environments, facilitating broader applications in climate and pollution studies.'}]

### GenSco: Can Question Decomposition based Passage Alignment improve Question Answering? (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10245v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10245v1]
- **Summary**: The paper introduces 'GenSco', a novel approach for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) in the context of Question Answering (QA). The research addresses inaccuracies and hallucinations in LLMs, often caused by inadequate context in prompts and poor reasoning through facts. 'GenSco' leverages a carefully selected passage sequence based on the predicted decomposition of multi-hop questions for better answer generation. This framework employs two distinct LLMs: (i) a Generator LLM for question decomposition and answer generation, and (ii) an auxiliary open-sourced LLM as a scorer for semantic guidance in passage selection. The evaluation on datasets like 2WikiMultiHop, Adversarial HotPotQA, and MuSiQue shows significant improvements, achieving an absolute gain of 15.1 and 5.9 points in Exact Match scores on MuSiQue and 2WikiMultiHop respectively, compared to the best performing baselines.

### Towards Robust Recommendation via Decision Boundary-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10184v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10184v1]
KDD 2024

- **Summary**: This paper presents RGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework for recommendation systems. The authors identify limitations in existing GCL models, which typically rely on heuristic approaches and assume entity independence when creating contrastive views. Such methods often struggle to balance semantic invariance and difficulty of views during training. RGCL addresses these issues by introducing adversarial perturbations that respect decision boundaries to preserve task-specific information. It employs an adversarial-contrastive learning objective to create relation-aware view generators that account for global user-user and item-item collaborations. Furthermore, the framework uses maximum perturbations to create adversarial examples that maximize margin and enhance model robustness. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RGCL over twelve baselines.

How does it contribute to the generation of hard contrastive views?'}, {'Question 5': 'RGCL introduces maximum perturbations to achieve margin maximization. Explain the concept of margin maximization and how it contributes to the robustness of the model.'}, {'Question 6': 'Contrast the theoretical analyses provided by the authors with the empirical results from the experiments.

### Warming Up Cold-Start CTR Prediction by Learning Item-Specific Feature Interactions (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10112v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10112v1]
KDD 2024

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of cold-start click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommendation systems where new items start with no interaction records and gradually accumulate them. Traditional methods tend to focus on enhancing item ID embeddings but often fail to effectively address the data sparsity issue for new items. The authors propose EmerG, a novel approach that warms up cold-start CTR predictions by learning item-specific feature interaction patterns. EmerG employs hypernetworks to generate item-specific feature graphs based on the characteristics of the new items. These graphs are then processed by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to capture feature interactions at any order through a customized message-passing mechanism. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to optimize the parameters of the hypernetworks and GNN across different item CTR prediction tasks, while only fine-tuning a minimal set of item-specific parameters to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that EmerG consistently outperforms existing methods across varying levels of data availability for new items.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Describe the mechanisms by which EmerG utilizes hypernetworks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to handle cold-start CTR prediction. How do these components interact to achieve item-specific feature interaction learning?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the meta-learning strategy employed in EmerG for optimizing the hypernetworks and GNNs. Why is this strategy effective in preventing overfitting, especially for new items with limited data?'}]

### Semantic Understanding and Data Imputation using Large Language Model to Accelerate Recommendation System (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10078v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10078v1]
- **Summary**: The paper addresses the challenge of sparse and missing data in recommendation systems. Traditional imputation techniques fail to adequately capture complex relationships within data. The authors propose a novel approach that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to impute missing data. By leveraging LLMs, which are trained on extensive textual data and can understand complex data relationships, the proposed method intelligently fills in missing information. This enriched data is subsequently used by recommendation systems to produce more accurate and personalized suggestions, thereby improving user experience. The LLM-based imputation method is evaluated across several recommendation system tasks—single classification, multi-classification, and regression—and is shown to outperform traditional imputation methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing recommendation system performance.

- **Summary**: The paper proposes an anomaly detection method tailored for multivariate time series data, aimed at identifying critical periods and features that influence extreme climate events, such as Arctic snowmelt. The method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with dynamic thresholding and correlation-based feature clustering. This approach improves the VAE's capacity to recognize localized dependencies and learn temporal relationships in climate data, thereby enhancing anomaly detection accuracy, as evidenced by a higher F1-score on benchmark datasets. The study's primary contributions are the development of a robust anomaly detection method, the enhancement of feature representation within VAEs through clustering, and the creation of a dynamic thresholding algorithm for localized anomaly detection, contributing to the explainability of climate anomalies across different regions.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain how the integration of dynamic thresholding and correlation-based feature clustering within the VAE framework enhances the detection of anomalies in multivariate time series data. What are the mechanisms by which these integrations improve the VAE’s performance?'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the advantages and potential limitations of using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for anomaly detection in the context of climate data. How does the method proposed in the paper address these limitations?'}]
