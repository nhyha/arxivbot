How does this problem fit within the broader field of study, and why is it significant?'}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the methodology used in the paper. What specific techniques or approaches were employed to address the research problem? How do these methods compare to previous work in the field?'}, {'Question 3': 'Analyze the experimental design and data used in the paper. How were experiments conducted, and what kind of data was collected? Discuss the validity and reliability of the experimental approach.'}, {'Question 4': 'Evaluate the results and findings presented. What were the main outcomes of the research? How do these results contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field?'}, {'Question 5': 'Discuss the broader implications of the research. How can the findings be applied in practice, and what potential impact might they have on the field or related areas of study?'}, {'Question 6': 'Critically assess both the strengths and limitations of the research. What aspects of the study are particularly robust, and where are there potential weaknesses or areas for further investigation?'}, {'Question 7': 'Propose a potential follow-up study based on the findings.
