- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of evaluating Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) by introducing LMMS-EVAL, a benchmark framework comprising over 50 tasks and more than 10 models. The framework aims to promote transparent and reproducible evaluations, though it struggles with cost and contamination issues. To tackle these, the authors propose LMMS-EVAL LITE, which balances coverage and efficiency, and Multimodal LIVEBENCH, which uses real-time data to assess model generalization at low cost and zero contamination. The authors provide practical solutions to the evaluation trilemma and open source their code and leaderboard for broader use.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': "Explain the concept of the 'evaluation trilemma' as described in the context of evaluating large multi-modal models and discuss how LMMS-EVAL LITE and Multimodal LIVEBENCH attempt to navigate this trilemma."}, {'Question 2': 'Compare and contrast LMMS-EVAL and LMMS-EVAL LITE in terms of their approaches to benchmarking large multi-modal models.

### The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12771v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12771v1]
- **Summary**: The paper investigates the role of two social factors - the topology of the Twitter social network and users' demographic identities - in the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter. The study analyzed 1,337 popular hashtags to determine the best model for predicting cascade properties. Results show that a combined model of network topology and identity outperforms single-factor models in reproducing cascade properties. However, the effectiveness of these factors varies for predicting different properties: network topology is better for predicting growth, and identity is better for adopter composition. The combined model is particularly effective for hashtags related to racial or regional identity, stance-taking, sports, or cultural trends. This demonstrates the importance of multi-factor models in understanding the complex dynamics of hashtag diffusion.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Explain the significance of using a combined model of network topology and user demographic identity in predicting hashtag cascades on Twitter, as opposed to using single-factor models. Provide examples from the paper to support your explanation.'}, {'Question 2': "How do the effectiveness of network topology and demographic identity vary in predicting different properties of hashtag cascades? Discuss specific properties and the corresponding factor's predictive performance based on the findings of the paper."}, {'Question 3': "Evaluate the paper's methodology in analyzing 1,337 popular hashtags for predicting cascade properties. What are the strengths and potential limitations of this approach?"}, {'Question 4': "Discuss how the combined network+identity model can outperform single-factor models in specific categories of hashtags, such as those expressing racial or regional identity or stance-taking. Use the paper's findings to support your discussion."}]

8 pages, including appendix with 8 figures and 12 tables, currently
  under open review for EMNLP 2024

- **Summary**: The paper investigates the impact of incorporating structural properties of knowledge graphs (KGs) into pre-trained language models (PLMs) for improving the performance of knowledge graph completion (KGC). Standard PLM-based methods primarily focus on textual information, neglecting various topological structures inherent to KGs. The authors introduce a Subgraph-Aware Training framework for KGC (SATKGC), which integrates subgraph-aware mini-batching and a novel contrastive learning approach to emphasize harder entities and negative triples in terms of structural properties. This framework marks the first comprehensive attempt to embed the structural inductive biases from subgraphs into the fine-tuning process of PLMs. The effectiveness of SATKGC is validated through extensive experiments across four KGC benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance. The code for SATKGC is made available for further research and application.

What are the strengths and potential limitations of the authors' validation approach for SATKGC?"}, {'Question 5': 'Given the findings of the paper, suggest further research directions or potential improvements for the SATKGC framework that could enhance its effectiveness in knowledge graph completion tasks.'}]



### Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12665v1]
- **Summary**: The paper introduces an innovative method called patch-level training to enhance the training efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, which involves high computational costs, patch-level training mitigates this by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. The LLM is trained using shorter sequences of these patches to predict the next patch, significantly reducing the sequence length and computational costs. After this patch-level training, traditional token-level training is resumed to align the model with its inference mode. Experimental results show that patch-level training can halve computational costs without degrading model performance, proven across an array of models ranging from 370 million to 2.7 billion parameters.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'Describe the primary computational inefficiency associated with traditional token-level training in LLMs. How does patch-level training address this inefficiency?'}, {'Question 2': 'Explain the concept of patch compression in the context of patch-level training for LLMs. How does this compression impact the sequence length and overall computational load?'}, {'Question 3': "Discuss the significance of continuing token-level training after patch-level training. How does this step ensure the model's alignment with its inference mode?"}, {'Question 4': 'Examine the experimental setup and evaluation metrics used in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of patch-level training. What range of model sizes were tested, and what were the key findings?'}, {'Question 5': 'Propose possible limitations or challenges that might arise from the implementation of patch-level training in LLMs. How might these be addressed in future research?'}]

### AgentPoison: Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12784v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784v1]
22 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables

- **Summary**: The paper presents AgentPoison, a novel red teaming approach aimed at backdoor attacks on LLM (Large Language Model) agents that utilize a memory module or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism. These agents rely on knowledge bases, which, if unverified, pose significant safety and trustworthiness issues. AgentPoison poisons the long-term memory or knowledge base of these agents by embedding malicious instances using optimized backdoor triggers. This optimization ensures that user instructions containing these triggers will retrieve malicious data with high probability, while benign instructions remain unaffected. The attack does not require additional model training or fine-tuning and maintains high attack success rates (above 80%) with minimal impact on benign performance and a low poison rate (less than 0.1%). The effectiveness of AgentPoison is demonstrated on three types of real-world LLM agents: an autonomous driving agent, a knowledge-intensive QA agent, and a healthcare EHRAgent.

What are the key factors that contribute to this optimization's effectiveness?"}, {'Question 2': 'Discuss the implications and potential risks of using a memory module or RAG mechanism in LLM agents, in the context of safety and trustworthiness. How does AgentPoison highlight these vulnerabilities?'}, {'Question 3': "How does AgentPoison's impact on benign performance compare to that of conventional backdoor attacks? Provide an analysis based on the reported experimental results."}, {'Question 4': "Describe the experimental setup used to evaluate AgentPoison's effectiveness on different types of LLM agents. How do these experiments ensure the reliability and validity of the results?"}, {'Question 5': 'Analyze the ethical considerations and potential consequences of using a backdoor attack like AgentPoison in real-world applications. What measures could be implemented to mitigate such risks?'}]

### Graph Signal Processing for Cross-Domain Recommendation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12374v1]
- **Summary**: The paper introduces a novel approach to Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR), a method that enhances traditional recommendation systems by utilizing user-item interactions across different domains to address issues of data sparsity and cold start. Existing CDR methods often struggle with the ratio of overlapping users and intrinsic discrepancies between domains. To address these challenges, the authors propose CGSP, a unified CDR framework leveraging Graph Signal Processing (GSP). This framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph that combines target-only and source-bridged similarities, processing personalized graph signals for inter-domain and intra-domain recommendations. Empirical evaluations show that CGSP outperforms various encoder-based CDR methods, particularly when there are low numbers of overlapping users, suggesting its effectiveness for practical applications.

### Object-Aware Query Perturbation for Cross-Modal Image-Text Retrieval (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12346v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12346v1]
ECCV 2024

- **Summary**: The paper presents a framework to enhance the performance of vision and language (V&L) models for cross-modal image-text retrieval, particularly focusing on improving the retrieval of small objects. Current V&L models often show limited performance in this area due to rough alignment between text and small objects in images. Human cognition tends to be object-centric and can focus on important objects even when they are small. To bridge this gap, the authors propose 'object-aware query perturbation,' which involves generating a key feature subspace for detected objects and perturbing the corresponding queries using this subspace. This approach maintains the expressive power and retrieval performance of existing V&L models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that their method outperforms conventional algorithms.

Provide an analysis based on the methodology described in the paper.'}, {'Question 4': 'Evaluate the significance of the experimental results presented in the paper. How do these results support the effectiveness of the proposed framework in comparison to conventional algorithms?'}, {'Question 5': 'In what ways could the proposed method be further expanded or improved to enhance its applicability and performance in cross-modal image-text retrieval?'}]



### GUME: Graphs and User Modalities Enhancement for Long-Tail Multimodal Recommendation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12338v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12338v1]
11 pages, accepted by CIKM 2024

- **Summary**: The paper discusses challenges in multimodal recommendation systems (MMRS) related to handling long-tail items with limited interaction data and the simplistic representations of user modality preferences. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel approach termed Graphs and User Modalities Enhancement (GUME).

### Mindful-RAG: A Study of Points of Failure in Retrieval Augmented Generation (http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12216v1) [pdf: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12216v1]
- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent text but struggle with domain-specific and factual question-answering tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance LLM performance by incorporating external knowledge from structured knowledge graphs (KGs). Despite this, LLMs often fail to provide accurate answers even when they have access to relevant KG-extracted information. The study identifies eight critical failure points in current KG-based RAG systems, noting that errors primarily stem from an inadequate focus on understanding the question's intent and gathering the relevant context. To address these issues, the authors propose the Mindful-RAG approach, which aims to improve response accuracy and relevance by focusing on intent-based and contextually aligned knowledge retrieval, thus addressing the identified failure points and marking a significant advancement over existing methods.

- **PhD-Level Questions**: [{'Question 1': 'What are the eight critical failure points identified in current KG-based RAG systems, and how do these points contribute to errors in LLM responses?'}, {'Question 2': "Explain the concept of 'intent-based and contextually aligned knowledge retrieval' as proposed in the Mindful-RAG approach. How does this method specifically address the identified failures in existing RAG methods?"}]
